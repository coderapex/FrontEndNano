## 05. Text Elements I

### Notes <!-- omit in toc -->

#### General Text Element Structures <!-- omit in toc -->

Syntax : `<p class="class-name">Text here</p>`

1. **The opening tag** is the first HTML tag used to start an element.
2. **The content** is the info contained between the opening and closing tags. Only this content inside the opening and closing body tags is displayed to the screen.
3. **The closing tag** is the second tag used to define the end of a single element. Closings tags have a forward slash / inside of them, always after the left angle bracket.
4. (Optional) **The attribute** name and value.

#### Block and Inline Elements <!-- omit in toc -->

##### Block Elements <!-- omit in toc -->

Block elements are meant to structure the main parts of your page, by dividing your content in coherent blocks.

Block elements are:

- paragraphs `<p>`
- lists:
  - unordered (with bullet points) `<ul>`, or
  - ordered - lists (with numbers) `<ol>`
- headings: from 1st level `<h1>` to 6th level headings - `<h6>`
- articles `<article>`
- sections `<section>`
- long quotes `<blockquote>`

##### Inline Elements <!-- omit in toc -->

Inline elements are meant to differentiate part of a text, to give it a particular function or meaning. Inline elements usually comprise a single or few words.

Inline elements are:

- links `<a>`
- emphasized words `<em>`
- important words `<strong>`

### Activity

There is no proposed activity for this lesson per se. Although for reference I have made an HTML which uses the block and inline elements discussed above.
